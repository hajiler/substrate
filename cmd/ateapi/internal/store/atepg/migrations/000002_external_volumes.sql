-- External volumes outlive the actors that mount them, so unlike an actor's
-- own volumes they are named and reclaimed in their own right. Shaped like
-- tags: atespace-scoped, and RESTRICT rather than CASCADE so that deleting an
-- atespace cannot silently strand storage that is still provisioned.
